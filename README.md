Whoa, okay wow just left the theater and my mind is like a tangled slinky right now. Inception just like blew my brain into a thousand little popcorn bits. Also, speaking of popcorn, my lap is a crumb fest, but who even cares right now?? The theater was buzzing, that annoying hum of people trying to figure out if they just saw the best   or the most confusing puzzle ever.

Leo DiCaprio just dived straight into dreams like some kind of mental synchronized swimmer, and I swear my back is hurting because I’ve been on the edge of my seat the whole darn time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floating around in zero gravity like he’s doing interpretive dance with the laws of physics — did not see that coming. How does he pull off looking so cool while everything’s literally upside down???

> Ellen Page just built Paris in like two seconds, flipping it like a pancake, and I’m just here trying to remember where I parked my car... Think about it, they went deeper into dreams like layers of a very unstable lasagna but with more explosions and existential dread. And that ending?? Is the top still spinning? I NEED TO KNOW, Chris Nolan!

Oh, and can we talk about Hans Zimmer?! The music was like it knew my heart’s rhythm better than my Fitbit. Also, why was there a random pigeon inside the theater today?? It was like a flying metaphor, or maybe not. Gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and over-analyze every detail again.

OK, friends, if you haven't 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   by now, what are you doing with your life??? It’s like trying to describe a kaleidoscope to a cat — you just have to experience it.

```
int main () {
   cout << Spin the top << endl;
   return 0;
}
